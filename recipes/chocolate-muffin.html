        <li>Water | 1 cup </li>
        <li>Chocolate chips | 1 cup </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 400 degree F or 200 degree C for at least 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Prepare the muffin tray, line it with muffin liners or spray with nonstick cooking spray or lightly butter it</li>
        <li>In a bowl, take flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt</li>
        <li>Mix them well. If your cocoa powder has many lumps then don't forget to sift it.</li>
        <li>In another bowl add oil, vanilla, vinegar and water.</li>
        <li>Whisk it very well.</li>
        <li>Then add dry mixture</li>
        <li>Whisk it till it gets incorporated well. Do not over beat it.</li>
        <li>Add chocolate chips</li>        
        <li>Switch to spatula and fold them in.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter in to prepared 12 muffins cups</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some chocolate chips on top. I am adding here so it looks better, if I am making it on regular basis for my family I wouldn't bother for this step.</li>
        <li>Bake into pre-heated oven for 20-22 minutes. Check by inserting a toothpick into the center and if it comes out clean then muffins are ready. Remove it from the oven; let them cook in a pan for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>After that it is cool to touch, remove them on cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
