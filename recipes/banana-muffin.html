    <h2>Eggless Recipe</h2>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole flour (maida) | 1 ½ cups</li>
        <li>Sugar | ¼ cup </li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder | 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Baking powder | 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Baking soda | ½ tsp</li>
        <li>Salt | ⅛ tsp</li>
        <li>Oil | ½ cup </li>
        <li>White distilled vinegar | 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Pure vanilla extract | 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Lemon Juice | 1 tbsp </li>
        <li>Banana | 3 large </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a muffin tray with muffin liners. Also preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius/356 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. You can use the same temperature for preheating in the convection mode of a microwave oven.</li>
        <li>In a bowl take chopped bananas together with the sugar. Begin to mash the bananas with a fork or a masher till smooth. A few small chunks of bananas are fine. You can also blitz the bananas and sugar in a blender to get a smooth puree</li>
        <li>Add oil. You can also use melted butter instead of oil</li>
        <li>Stir the mixture very well with a wired whisk so that the oil is mixed evenly</li>
        <li>Add vanilla extract or powder and mix to combine evenly</li>
        <li>Then add lemon juice. Mix again very well and keep this wet mixture aside</li>
        <li>Begin to sieve whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt directly in the wet ingredients bowl. You can also sieve the dry ingredients in a plate or tray and then add later</li>
        <li>Holding a spatula, with light hands gently fold the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients. Don’t over do the folding</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter in muffin liners till ¾ of the liners. Using a spatula remove the excess batter from the bowl and add to the muffin liners</li>        
        <li>Place the muffin tray in the center rack with both the top and bottom heating elements of an otg</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius/356 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 to 35 minutes or till a toothpick inserted comes out clean. The recipe yields 10 regular sized banana muffins</li>
        <li>Temperatures in ovens differ, so do keep a check while baking. Your oven might bake the muffins in 20 minutes or even 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>It took a total of 35 minutes for the muffins to bake in my oven. The tops should be golden</li>
        <li>The final check is that a tooth pick should come out dry or with fine crumb particles. There should be no stickiness. Use the same temperature for baking in the convection mode of a microwave oven</li>
        <li>Once warm or cooled at room temperature, serve these eggless banana muffins as sweet snack or dessert</li>
